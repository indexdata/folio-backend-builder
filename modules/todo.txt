If going to use config json: 

- Make config validation script? 
  - list from "selectedModules"
    - look up each module in "modulesConfig"
    - fail if config not found
  - Go through configs from modulesConfig
    Validate that
    - It has "name", 
             "version", 
             "checkedOutTo", 
             "requiredBy", 
             "deployment", 
             "deployment.type"
      - if "deployment.type" is not "DOCKER", that is has "jvm", "pathToJar"
        - if "deployment.type" is DD-PG or DD-PG-KAFKA, that it has "pgHost"
    - "checkedOutTo" exist in "checkOutRoots"
    - "deployment.jvm" (if any) exists in "jvms" 
    - "deployment.type" exists in "ddTypes"
